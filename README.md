Installation
============
Option 1: bulding from source
-----------------------------
Download the source code and use .net 5.0 to build.

Option 2: Just download the compiled folder
-------------------------------------------
Download the Compiled folder if on windows. If you're on another platform, you'll have to compile the source code for your OS.

I recommend adding the bin\\Debug\\net5.0 folder to PATH so you can access the GIL compiler from anywhere. You'll need to restart VSCode for this to work.
