Welcome to GIL's documentation!
===============================
GIL is a collection of tools designed to simplify genetic engineering. 
**This is still early in development, the future of this project is unknown and built versions may be unstable.**

Installation
============
Option 1: bulding from source
-----------------------------
Download the source code and use .net 5.0 to build.

Option 2: Just download the compiled folder
-------------------------------------------
Download the Compiled folder if on windows. If you're on another platform, you'll have to compile the source code for your OS.

I recommend adding the bin\Debug\net5.0 folder to PATH so you can access the GIL compiler from anywhere. You'll need to restart VSCode for this to work.
